h1. Freebie

Tell EE to ignore certain segments when routing. This allows you to put useful segments in the URI without getting 404s, bad templates, or messing up the routing "Structure":http://www.buildwithstructure.com uses.

Freebie is built to run in ExpressionEngine 2.0, and will 100% fail in anything lower. To install:

* Copy freebie into your /system/expressionengine/third_party/ directory.
* Go to Add-ons -> Extensions and "Enable extension."

h2. Template Tags

Inside a template, you can access the original, un-effed-with URL segments using @{freebie_1}, {freebie_2}@, etc. These will return the segments you see in your browser's location bar &mdash; however, if you use @{segment_1}@ instead, you'll get back the segments EE is actually parsing. For example, if you set "preview" and "comments" as Freebie segments, and visit...

*/blog/preview/my-favorite-post/comments/*

...your template vars will return the following:

{segment_1} == blog
{segment_2} == my-favorite-post
{freebie_1} == blog
{freebie_2} == preview
{freebie_3} == my-favorite-post
{freebie_4} == comments

You can also use {exp:freebie:any name="segment_name"} to see if any segment — freebie or no — matches the "name" string. Example:

*/blog/preview/my-favorite-post/comments/*

@{exp:freebie:any name="blog"} == "true"@

@{if {exp:freebie:any name="comments"} == "true"}<h2>Show comments</h2>{/if}@

h2. Settings

h3. Basic Settings

@preview|success|error@

@preview
success
error@

h3. Wildcards

@march|april|may|ju*|august@

The wildcard in @ju*@ means that both @june@ and @july@ will be freebie segments. 

h3. Numbers

You can set an option to automatically ignore all number-only segments - this is useful for using urls like blog/2010/20/ in Structure.

h3. Break Segments

Break segments are entered just like Freebie segments, but instead of being ignored, break segments tell EE to ignore all *following* segments. Example: You're working in Structure, and want to use author urls and dates to control a blog, like so: /blog/lucille/2010/10. If you set "blog" as a break segment, you can throw whatever you want into the URI *after* this point without it affecting the template or page routing.

h1. Where Credit Is Due

I only made this extension after using Leevi Graham's "NSM Safe Segments":http://github.com/newism/nsm.safe_segments.ee_addon for a loooong time and missing it dearly in EE 2.0. Once I got started, I just kept adding features that we've had a need for at Viget from time to time.
