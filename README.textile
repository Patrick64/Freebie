Freebie is built to run in EE 2.0 ONLY.

h2. What it Does

Freebie allows you to pick segment names that you want EE to completely ignore when routing. This throwing "success" messages after forms, creating "preview" pages, working with  "Structure":http://www.buildwithstructure.com, and much, much more.

h2. Installation

* Copy freebie into your /system/expressionengine/third_party/ directory.
* Go to Add-ons -> Extensions and "Enable extension."

h2. Usage

Enter the segments you want to ignore on the extensions page in Addons > Extensions. You can use wildcards in your segment names! Examples:

h4. Basic Settings

@preview|success|error@

@preview
success
error@

h4. Wildcards

@march|april|may|ju*|august@

The wildcard in @ju*@ means that both @june@ and @july@ will be freebie segments. 

h4. Numbers

You can also set an option to automatically ignore all number-only segments - this is useful for using urls like blog/2010/20/ in Structure.

h3. Templates

The *original* segments will be available in their standard form, as @{segment_1}@, @{segment_2}@, etc. For example, if your settings are @preview|*interns@ and the url is:

@http://www.mysite.com/preview/about/2009interns/bios/@

a {segment_3} tag will output '2009interns', even though that segment is being ignored by the rest of EE.

h2. Where Credit Is Due

I only made this extension after using Leevi Graham's "NSM Safe Segments":http://github.com/newism/nsm.safe_segments.ee_addon for a loooong time and missing it dearly in EE 2.0. Once I got started, I had to work in the number setting, and the wildcard was a last-minute gimme.
