h1. Freebie

Tell EE to ignore certain segments when routing. This allows you to put useful segments in the URI without getting 404s, bad templates, or messing up the routing "Structure":http://www.buildwithstructure.com uses.

Freebie is built to run in ExpressionEngine 2.0, and will 100% fail in anything lower. To install:

* Copy freebie into your /system/expressionengine/third_party/ directory.
* Go to Add-ons -> Extensions and "Enable extension."

h2. Usage

Enter the segments you want to ignore on the extensions page in Addons > Extensions. You can use wildcards in your segment names!

h3. Basic Settings

@preview|success|error@

@preview
success
error@

h3. Wildcards

@march|april|may|ju*|august@

The wildcard in @ju*@ means that both @june@ and @july@ will be freebie segments. 

h3. Numbers

You can set an option to automatically ignore all number-only segments - this is useful for using urls like blog/2010/20/ in Structure.

h3. Break Segments

Break segments are entered just like Freebie segments, but instead of being ignored, break segments tell EE to ignore all *following* segments. Example: You're working in Structure, and want to use author urls and dates to control a blog, like so: /blog/lucille/2010/10. If you set "blog" as a break segment, you can throw whatever you want into the URI *after* this point without it affecting the template or page routing.

h3. Templates

The *original* segments will be available in their standard form, as @{segment_1}@, @{segment_2}@, etc. For example, if your settings are @preview|*interns@ and the url is /preview/about/2009interns/bios/, a @{segment_3}@ tag will output '2009interns', even though that segment is being ignored by the rest of EE.

h1. Where Credit Is Due

I only made this extension after using Leevi Graham's "NSM Safe Segments":http://github.com/newism/nsm.safe_segments.ee_addon for a loooong time and missing it dearly in EE 2.0. Once I got started, I had to work in the number setting, and the wildcard was a last-minute gimme.
